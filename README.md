# Equivalent States Of A DFA
This script allows the user to input all the aspects of a DFA in a .txt file. According to the transition table, the script will find the states equivalent to others, simplifying the DFA.

## Students participating in the project
- Simon Sloan Garcia Villa
- Alejandro Tirado Ramirez
  
Class number **7308**

## Details about the tools used for making the script
- The script was made using Python 3.12.9.
- The operating systems we used for the testing and programming were Windows 11 and Kali Linux (Version 2024.4).
- The tools used for the project were:
  
    - **Visual Studio** as the editor.
    - **Git** for version control.
    - **GitHub** was used to upload the code to the cloud.
      
- The main algorithm was implemented based on lecture 14 of the book *Automata and Computability* by Kozen

## How to run the code?

First, clone the Github project on your machine. Then, if you want to modify the script's inputs, you will need to modify the .txt document. The document already contains five cases (one extra that we took from Kozen's book). After changing the document data or leaving it untouched, you can run the script the way you prefer.
